  * While generally shorter than competing educational psychology textbooks, Essentials of Educational Psychologystill provides a comprehensive overview of theories, research, and educational implications related to learning and cognition, motivation, child and adolescent development, instructional methods, classroom management, and assessment. Each chapter is organized around three to six Big Ideas, and each Big Idea is then divided into several more specific bold-faced principles or recommendations. Widely acclaimed for its conversational writing style, the book provides readers with a clear and easily understood picture of the psychological principles that impact teaching and learning. The Enhanced Pearson eText in Pearson MyLab Education includes dozens of hotlinks to illustrative classroom videos, animated video explanations of difficult concepts, interactive application exercises, self-check quizzes, and optional supplementary readings. Instructors have access to numerous supplementary materials to assist them in their instruction and assessments, including PowerPoint slides, an Instructor’s Manual and accompanying PowerPoint slides, and a Test Bank of multiple choice and short answer questions aligned with each chapter and Big Idea.
